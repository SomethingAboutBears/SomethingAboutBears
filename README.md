### Hi there 🐼🐻
- 🌌 I am interested in learning C++ and OpenFOAM.
- 🧊 I am currently working on my bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering, and finding more ways to get into computational fluid dynamics.
- 🎍 My hobbies include theme park and strategy games, mathematics, and ultimately unconstructive political discussions.
